The Nautilus DevOps team is trying to setup a simple Apache web server on all app servers in Stratos DC using Ansible. 
They also want to create a sample html page for now with some app specific data on it. Below you can find more details about the task.
You will find a valid inventory file /home/thor/playbooks/inventory on jump host (which we are using as an Ansible controller).

1. Create a playbook index.yml under /home/thor/playbooks directory on jump host. Using blockinfile Ansible module create a file facts.txt under /root directory on all app servers and add below given block in it. You will need to enable facts gathering for this task.
Ansible managed node IP is <default ipv4 address>
(You can obtain default ipv4 address from Ansible's gathered facts by using correct Ansible variable taking into account Jinja2 syntax)
2. Install httpd server on all apps. After that make a copy of facts.txt file as index.html under /var/www/html. Make sure to start httpd service after that.
Note: Do not create a separate role for this task, just add all changes in index.yml playbook.

#thor@jump_host /$ cat /home/thor/playbooks/inventory
#stapp01 ansible_host=172.16.238.10 ansible_ssh_pass=Ir0nM@n ansible_user=tony
#stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@ ansible_user=steve
#stapp03 ansible_host=172.16.238.12 ansible_ssh_pass=BigGr33n ansible_user=banner
